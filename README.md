This repository contains a simple demo showing how you can mix a 3D scene (via A‑Frame) with a 2D canvas (via p5.js) to build interactive e‑learning content. Open `elearning-canvas/index.html` in a modern web browser to try it.

Features include:

- Drag‑and‑resize an uploaded image on the 2D canvas
- Click the box in the 3D scene to toggle an annotation
- A small ribbon toolbar with an upload icon for convenience
