This repository contains a simple example of a 3D and 2D canvas for creating gamified e‑learning content. Open `elearning-canvas/index.html` in a modern web browser to try the demo.

The demo lets you:

- Load an image onto the 2D canvas
- Drag the image around
- Resize the image using a handle while keeping it sharp
- View a small example 3D scene

## Fullscreen Demo

`fullscreen-genially.html` shows how to force a Genially embed into full-screen mode using a high z-index overlay.
